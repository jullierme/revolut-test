# Revolut test
Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation)  for money transfers between accounts.  

## Explicit requirements:  

1. You can use Java, Scala or Kotlin.  
2. Keep it simple and to the point (e.g. no need to implement any authentication).  
3. Assume the API is invoked by multiple systems and services on behalf of end users.  
4. You can use frameworks/libraries if you like (except Spring), but don't forget about  
requirement #2 â€“ keep it simple and avoid heavy frameworks.  
5. The datastore should run in-memory for the sake of this test.  
6. The final result should be executable as a standalone program (should not require  
a pre-installed container/server).  
7. Demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected.  

## Implicit requirements:  
9. The code produced by you is expected to be of high quality.  
10. There are no detailed requirements, use common sense.

# Instructions

### Test

    $ gradlew test
    
### Build

    $ gradlew build

### Run

    $ java -jar revolut-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
    
    
### Server
   
   The Application starts a jetty server on localhost port 8080 with two sample accounts 
   
- http://localhost:8080/api/account/18181818
##### Response:
```sh
{
    "id": 18181818,
    "name": "Jullierme Barros",
    "balance": 1000000.00
} 
```
- http://localhost:8080/api/account/17171717
##### Response:
```sh
{
    "id": 17171717,
    "name": "Manoela Barros",
    "balance": 1000000.00
} 
```

### Available Services

| HTTP METHOD | PATH | USAGE |
| -----------| ------ | ------ |
| POST | /api/account | create a new account
| GET | /api/account/{accountId} | get account by accountId | 
| POST | /api/transaction | perform transaction between 2 accounts | 
| GET | /api/transaction/{transactionId} | get transaction by id | 
 
### Http Status
- 200 OK
- 400 Bad Request 
- 404 Not Found
- 500 Internal Server Error 

### Sample JSON for Account and Transaction
#### Account:
##### Request: 
```sh
{  
   "name":"Jullierme",
   "balance":100
} 
```
##### Response:
```sh
Header:
"Location":"http://localhost:8080/api/account/18181819"
```

#### Transaction:
##### Request:
```sh
{  
   "fromAccountId":18181818,
   "toAccountId":17171717
   "amount":10,
}
```

##### Response:
```sh
{
    "id": 1,
    "fromAccountId": 18181818,
    "toAccountId": 17171717,
    "amount": 10.00
}
```

#### More information

 - To ensure that an account does not transfer amounts without balance, the transfer method uses database transaction control.  
 - To check asynchronous tests, please see the classes * StressTest.java
